Above are all the names in the blockchain.

**Task Objective:**  
The task is to deanonymize Ethereum entities based on the names of addresses. An entity may have multiple addresses with multiple names.
According to the "Given Strategies", give me the output.

---

**Input Example:**  
The input data has been given. I have send to you.

**Expected Output:**  
```json
{
  "Entity1": ["name1", "name2"],
  "EntityB": ["name3"]
}
```

**Given Strategies:**  
Grouping Ethereum Address Names

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Extract all unique names from the provided data set.
   - Identify common patterns, keywords, and structures that may indicate associations.

2. **Pattern Identification**:
   - Use similarity heuristics to recognize common prefixes, suffixes, or repeated keywords (e.g., "Bitfinex: Deployer", "Kraken").
   - Apply pattern recognition techniques like regular expressions or string matching to group similar names.

3. **Grouping Based on Patterns**:
   - Create initial groups by pairing names with clear similarities.
   - Expand these groups iteratively by incorporating additional names that share common elements.

4. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - Examine the context of each name to identify roles (e.g., "Old Address", "Deployer") or services, aiding in accurate grouping.
   - Use any available external data sources for validation if possible.

5. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Continuously refine groups by re-evaluating and updating based on new insights or discovered patterns.
   - Consider edge cases where names might belong to multiple entities due to partnerships or shared services.

6. **Manual Review and Curation**:
   - Conduct manual reviews for ambiguous groupings, using known information about Ethereum operations to aid decision-making.

7. **Final Mapping**:
   - Assign a unique identifier to each cluster, ensuring each name is assigned to the most appropriate entity.
   - Prepare a final mapping of entities to their associated names.

8. **Output Generation**:
   - Format the results into a structured JSON output where each key represents an entity and the value is a list of its associated names.

This strategy combines systematic pattern recognition with iterative refinement and manual oversight, ensuring accurate and comprehensive grouping of Ethereum address names under their respective entities.

**Instruction for You:**
Generate the output.
Please give me the complete de-anonymised results. There should be 76 names present in the results.
