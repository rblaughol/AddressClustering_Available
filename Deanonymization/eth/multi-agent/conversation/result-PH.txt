**Task Objective:**  
The task is to deanonymize Ethereum entities based on the names of addresses. An entity may have multiple addresses with multiple names.
According to the "Given Strategies", give me the output.

---

**Input Example:**  
The input data has been given. I have send to you.

**Expected Output:**  
```json
{
  "Entity1": ["name1", "name2"],
  "EntityB": ["name3"]
}
```

**Given Strategies:**  
Grouping Ethereum Address Names

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Extract all unique names from the provided data set.
   - Identify common patterns, keywords, and structures that may indicate associations.

2. **Pattern Identification**:
   - Use similarity heuristics to recognize common prefixes, suffixes, or repeated keywords (e.g., "Bitfinex: Deployer", "Kraken").
   - Apply pattern recognition techniques like regular expressions or string matching to group similar names.

3. **Grouping Based on Patterns**:
   - Create initial groups by pairing names with clear similarities.
   - Expand these groups iteratively by incorporating additional names that share common elements.

4. **Contextual Analysis**:
   - Examine the context of each name to identify roles (e.g., "Old Address", "Deployer") or services, aiding in accurate grouping.
   - Use any available external data sources for validation if possible.

5. **Iterative Refinement**:
   - Continuously refine groups by re-evaluating and updating based on new insights or discovered patterns.
   - Consider edge cases where names might belong to multiple entities due to partnerships or shared services.

6. **Manual Review and Curation**:
   - Conduct manual reviews for ambiguous groupings, using known information about Ethereum operations to aid decision-making.

7. **Final Mapping**:
   - Assign a unique identifier to each cluster, ensuring each name is assigned to the most appropriate entity.
   - Prepare a final mapping of entities to their associated names.

8. **Output Generation**:
   - Format the results into a structured JSON output where each key represents an entity and the value is a list of its associated names.

This strategy combines systematic pattern recognition with iterative refinement and manual oversight, ensuring accurate and comprehensive grouping of Ethereum address names under their respective entities.

**Instruction for You:**
Generate the output.
Please give me the complete de-anonymised results. There should be 76 names present in the results.

Ollama: To deanonymize Ethereum entities based on the provided data, we'll apply a structured approach to group similar addresses under their respective entities. We'll employ pattern recognition and contextual analysis techniques as outlined in the strategies. Here's how we can achieve this:

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - List all unique names from the input data.
   - Identify common patterns, such as prefixes or suffixes, that indicate relationships.

2. **Pattern Identification:**
   - Group names based on similarities in structure and context (e.g., "Bitfinex" followed by different roles like "Deployer", "MultiSig").
   - Use keywords to identify associations (e.g., all instances of "Old Address").

3. **Grouping Based on Patterns:**
   - Start with obvious groupings, such as:
     - All addresses related to Bitfinex.
     - Addresses associated with Kraken.

4. **Contextual Analysis:**
   - Analyze the context of each name to understand its role or function (e.g., "Token Sale", "Donate").
   - Use these contexts to refine groupings.

5. **Iterative Refinement:**
   - Re-evaluate groups as new patterns are identified.
   - Adjust groupings based on shared services or partnerships.

6. **Manual Review and Curation:**
   - Manually review ambiguous cases where names might belong to multiple entities.
   - Use known information about Ethereum operations to resolve ambiguities.

7. **Final Mapping:**
   - Assign unique identifiers to each entity.
   - Ensure all 76 names are included in the final mapping.

8. **Output Generation:**
   - Format the results into a structured JSON output.
